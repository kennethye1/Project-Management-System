# Project-Management-System
A Project Management System using React, PostgreSQL, NodeJS and Express. 

To start, cd pms and for the front-end, cd to client and run npm start. Similarly for the back-end, cd server and npm start. 

Note that I used axios to do HTTP requests and also react-bootstrap for the front-end CSS.

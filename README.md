# Project-Management-System
A Project Management System using React, PostgreSQL, NodeJS and Express. 

After cloning the project, install Node.js if you haven't already and npm i express axios dotenv react-bootstrap. 
To start the front-end, cd into the client and npm start and similarly for backend but for the server folder. 

Note that I used axios to do HTTP requests and also react-bootstrap for the front-end CSS.
